- Start with small run, ~dozens of plots, test logging/validator
- Scale to 200-500 plots, test cost and scalability/error rate
- Production run, 5000 CONUS plots (nb: potential to do partial run through 2022, and catch up with 2023 in January, for speed)

# N.B., after mid-January, this will become a critical blocker to LCNext R&V
